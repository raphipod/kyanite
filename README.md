# Kyanite

### Sane. Stable. Supple.

Kyanite is your canvas in form of a desktop! Forget the mess of shattered windows.

Imagine Kinoite with added goodies. Kyanite positions itself between Kinoite and Aurora.

The distro is generally aimed at advanced Linux users who are used to working with immutable systems, especially
ostree-based ones.

Those brave await a no-bullshit Plasma desktop with the Wayland session and sane defaults.
Everything just straight up werks™️. If an update breaks, it can be rolled back.

These applications are pre-installed by default:

- KDE Core Apps (Discover, Konsole, Dolphin)
- Firefox

There will be two versions for different hardware platforms:

- Kyanite (for AMD/Intel-based CPU & GPU desktops)
- Kyanite-nvidia (for NVIDIA GPU desktops, contains the open-source NVIDIA drivers)

Kyanite is meant for Desktops only. There are many good alternative distros for handhelds already.

### Seriously? Yet another uBlue-based distro?

No. The uBlue-Distros are way too focused on doing one thing and (mostly) way too bloated. Kyanite tries
to be a general tool, a workbench with only the necessities to get you started. With the powerful
"just"-utility, Kyanite can be a simple browsing machine, a gaming machine, or even a fully-fledged
development environment.
