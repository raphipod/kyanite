# Kyanite

!! STILL WIP !!

### Sane. Stable. Supple.

Kyanite is a uBlue-based Desktop Linux distribution.

Imagine Kinoite with added goodies. Kyanite positions itself between Kinoite and Aurora.

The distro is generally aimed at advanced Linux users who are used to working with immutable systems, especially
ostree-based ones.

It utilizes the powerful Plasma desktop with it's Wayland display server.

## Kyanite follows these simple guidelines - you should too:

1.  Install graphical apps with **Flatpak (Discover)**
2.  Install CLI-Tools with **Homebrew (brew)**
3.  As a last resort: Layer RPM-Packages with `rpm-ostree install`  
  

These applications are pre-installed by default:

```
- KDE Core Apps (Discover, Konsole, Dolphin)
- Firefox
```

## There will be two versions for different hardware platforms:

| Editions         | for                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Kyanite`        |  AMD/Intel-based CPU & GPU desktops                                 |
| `Kyanite-nvidia` |  NVIDIA GPU desktops, contains the open-source NVIDIA drivers       |


Kyanite is meant for Desktops only. There are many good alternative distros for handhelds already.

### Seriously? Yet another uBlue-based distro?

You are right. You don't have to like it.

If you want to know my justification for this distro, read ahead:
The uBlue-Distros are way too focused on doing one thing and (mostly) way too bloated. Kyanite tries
to be a general tool, a workbench with only the necessities to get you started.
